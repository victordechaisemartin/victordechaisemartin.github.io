            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>I'm excited to share with you a project that holds a special place in my heart â€“ a deep exploration of diabetes data analysis. As a Type 1 diabetic, I understand firsthand the daily challenges and importance of managing this condition. 
                In this project, I explore my own personal glucose data, gathered with my Freestyle Libre sensor. Through this initiative, I aim to gain insights into my own well-being and improvment of my diabetes management over the years.

            <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>First, lets plot our data to have a better understanding of my glucose levels</p>
            <!-- Plot 1  -->
            <div class="plot-item">
                <img src="../../ressources/images/project2/plot1.png" alt="Glucose levels over the years">
                <p><strong>Evolution of my glucose levels</strong> Here, you can see a lot of variation in my glucose levels. In an ideal scenario, my glucose levels need to stay in a between 90mg/dL and 180 mg/dL. However it is often difficult to manage as you need to pay attention, to what you are eating, what insulin dose you need to administer, the physical activity you have been doing over the past hours, the emotional state you are in and the current glucose levels you are currently at.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Plot 2 -->
            <div class="plot-item">
                <img src="../../ressources/images/project2/plot2.png" alt="Daily Glucose Trends over the past 4 years">
                <p><strong>Daily Glucose Trends over the past 4 years:</strong> A closer look at the daily fluctuations help us see that my glucose levels are steadily decreasing which is good. 2021 was a very bad year as yo ucan see that my average glucose is above the wanted range.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Plot 3 -->
            <div class="plot-item">
                <img src="../../ressources/images/project2/plot3.png" alt="Time in range over the past 4 years">
                <p><strong>Time in range over the past 4 years:</strong> In this analysis, you can compare the time in range for my glucose levels over the past 4 years. Again, you can see that in 2021, my glucose levels were not at all in range. However, there has been a noticable improvement in 2022 and even more in 2023.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Plot 4 -->
            <div class="plot-item">
                <img src="../../ressources/images/project2/plot4.png" alt="Evolution of A1c over the past 4 years">
                <p><strong>Evolution of A1c:</strong> A1c is a good indicator to evaluate your blood sugar control. This metric corresponds to the percentage of hemoglobin proteins in your blood are coated with sugar. It uses the last 3 months of glucose data. <br><br>
                    A good range for diabetes is too maintain your A1c under 7.5. As you can see in 2021 my A1c increased significantly. In 2023, I have reached my objective of decreasing my A1C below 7.5. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="results">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As a conclusion, I am very happy to have used my own glucose data for this project. It was very instructive to learn how to properly collect my own data, process it and use visualisations to better understand it. This helped me understand how my glucose levels have evolved over the past 4 years and motivated me to keep improving my diabetes management. Indeed, you can see that 2023 has shown significant improvements and much better glucose levels. <br><br>
            The next steps for this project would be to collect more data such as the daily insuline intakes, meals, physical activity and more. This could help me create a machine learning model that could predict my glucose level in the upcoming hours based on the current data. With this information I could add insulin or eat sugar to avoir being outside the wanted range.</p>
